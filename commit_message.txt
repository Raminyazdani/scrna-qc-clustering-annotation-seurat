Ramin Yazdani | Single-Cell RNA-Seq QC and Clustering | main | feat(clustering): Implement k-NN graph construction and Louvain clustering

Implemented k-nearest neighbor graph construction and graph-based clustering using the Louvain 
algorithm, which is more robust than k-means for the complex geometries typical in scRNA-seq data.

Modified scrna_analysis.r to add:
- FindNeighbors() using automatically selected PCs:
  * k = 20 neighbors (standard default for scRNA-seq)
  * Constructs shared nearest neighbor (SNN) graph
  * Captures local structure in high-dimensional space
- FindClusters() with Louvain community detection algorithm:
  * Single resolution: 0.5 (moderate granularity)
  * Optimizes modularity to find natural communities
- Basic cluster visualization with UMAP initialization

Graph-based clustering is the gold standard for scRNA-seq analysis. It's more robust to the 
complex, non-convex geometries of single-cell data compared to methods like k-means. The SNN 
graph construction captures local neighborhood relationships, which is crucial when biological 
cell types may not be well-separated in global space.

The Louvain algorithm efficiently identifies densely connected communities (clusters) in the graph, 
which correspond to cell types or states. Resolution parameter of 0.5 provides moderate granularity 
suitable for identifying major cell types without excessive fragmentation.
