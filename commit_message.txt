Ramin Yazdani | Single-Cell RNA-Seq QC and Clustering | main | feat(qc): Implement QC strategy comparison and visualization suite

Added comprehensive visualization functions to compare the three QC strategies (threshold-only, 
outlier-only, combined) and select the optimal approach based on visual and quantitative assessment.

Modified scrna_analysis.r to add:
- Side-by-side violin plots comparing pre/post QC for each strategy
- Cell retention statistics table quantifying filtering impact
- Scatter plots with density coloring for nCount vs nFeature
- Final QC visualization suite with multiple panels
- Selected "outlier then threshold" (combined) as optimal strategy

The visualization suite enables data-driven comparison of QC strategies. Key metrics evaluated:
- Number of cells retained (balance QC stringency with statistical power)
- Distribution changes in QC metrics (ensure problematic cells removed)
- Visual separation between kept and removed cells

Comparing multiple QC strategies ensures we choose the optimal approach for this specific dataset. 
Visual and quantitative comparison informs the decision. Documenting the choice and rationale 
provides transparency and justification for the selected strategy. The combined approach was 
selected as it provides both data-adaptive and biology-constrained filtering.

Verified by: Code review of visualization functions and comparison logic.
