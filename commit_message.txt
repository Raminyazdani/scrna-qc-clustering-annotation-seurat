Ramin Yazdani | Single-Cell RNA-Seq QC and Clustering | main | feat(annotation): Implement automated cell type annotation using SingleR

Integrated SingleR for automated cell type annotation using established reference datasets, 
providing unbiased cell type labels based on reference transcriptomes.

Modified scrna_analysis.r to add:
- Convert Seurat to SingleCellExperiment format for SingleR compatibility
- Run SingleR with HumanPrimaryCellAtlasData reference (broad cell types)
- Run SingleR with BlueprintEncodeData reference (immune focus)
- Add both annotation sets to Seurat object metadata
- Generate UMAP plots colored by automated annotations from each reference
- Calculate cell type proportions:
  * Per sample (identify sample composition differences)
  * Per condition (BMMC vs CD34+ comparison)
- Confusion matrix comparing two reference annotations for validation

SingleR performs reference-based automated annotation by comparing each cell's transcriptome to 
reference datasets with known labels. Uses correlation-based scoring to assign labels. Running 
multiple references provides cross-validation - agreement suggests confident annotation, 
disagreement suggests ambiguous or novel cell states.

Automated annotation provides consistent, unbiased labels and serves as essential first pass 
before manual curation. HumanPrimaryCellAtlas provides broad coverage, BlueprintEncode focuses 
on immune cells (appropriate for bone marrow). Cell type proportions reveal whether expected cell 
types are present and whether conditions differ as expected.

Verified by: Code review of SingleR implementation and reference selection.
