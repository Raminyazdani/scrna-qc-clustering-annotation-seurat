Ramin Yazdani | Single-Cell RNA-Seq QC and Clustering | main | feat(de): Add differential expression analysis framework

Implemented differential expression (DE) analysis framework using Wilcoxon rank-sum test to 
identify marker genes that distinguish cell types and reveal condition-specific differences.

Modified scrna_analysis.r to add:
- FindMarkers() wrapper function with optimized parameters
- Conservative filter criteria for biological relevance:
  * min.pct = 0.25 (gene must be expressed in ≥25% of cells in at least one group)
  * logfc.threshold = 0.25 (≥1.19-fold change, log2FC ≥ 0.25)
- Wilcoxon rank-sum test (default, non-parametric, no normality assumption)
- Bonferroni correction for multiple testing to control family-wise error rate
- DE result formatting with gene symbols, fold changes, and adjusted p-values
- Export functionality for downstream analysis

Differential expression identifies genes that define each cell type (markers) and genes that 
differ between conditions or states. Wilcoxon test is robust for scRNA-seq data which violates 
parametric test assumptions (not normally distributed, many zeros, overdispersion).

Conservative thresholds reduce false positives - requiring 25% expression ensures genes are 
meaningfully present, 0.25 log-fold-change ensures biological relevance beyond noise. Bonferroni 
correction (strict) prevents false discoveries in multiple testing. This framework scales to 
multiple comparisons needed for comprehensive analysis.

Verified by: Code review of DE implementation and threshold selection.
