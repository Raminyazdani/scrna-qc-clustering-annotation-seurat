Ramin Yazdani | Single-Cell RNA-Seq QC and Clustering | main | feat(integration): Identify integration anchors across samples

Implemented the first phase of Seurat integration: identifying mutual nearest neighbors (anchors) 
across samples that represent shared cell states. These anchors guide batch effect correction.

Modified scrna_analysis.r to add:
- Prepare sample list for integration workflow
- Select integration features (2000 most variable genes shared across samples)
- FindIntegrationAnchors() implementation:
  * Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) for dimensionality reduction
  * Identify mutual nearest neighbors (MNN) across sample pairs
  * Score anchor confidence based on neighborhood consistency
  * Filter low-quality anchors
- Visualize anchor distribution across samples to verify quality
- Save anchors object for integration step

Anchor identification is the critical first step of Seurat integration. Anchors should represent 
cells in the same biological state across samples, not shared technical artifacts. CCA identifies 
shared sources of variation while downweighting sample-specific variation.

Mutual nearest neighbors (cells that are each other's nearest neighbors across samples) provide 
robust anchor points. These anchors act as correspondence points to align samples while preserving 
biological differences. Anchor scoring ensures only high-confidence correspondences are used, 
preventing incorrect alignment that could distort biology.

Verified by: Code review of anchor finding implementation and parameters.
