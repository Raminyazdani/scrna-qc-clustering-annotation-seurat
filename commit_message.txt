Ramin Yazdani | Single-Cell RNA-Seq QC and Clustering | main | WIP(doublet): Integrate DoubletFinder for doublet detection

Added DoubletFinder integration to identify and remove doublets (two cells mistaken as one droplet), 
which can create artificial cell types in clustering analysis. Contains library import typo.

Modified scrna_analysis.r to add:
- DoubletFinder parameter sweep for optimal pK selection
- pN-pN plot analysis to identify optimal neighborhood size
- Expected doublet rate calculation based on 10X Genomics loading guidelines
- Doublet classification and scoring for all cells
- Doublet removal workflow

MISTAKE INTRODUCED: Used `library(DoubletFider)` with typo in package name (should be 
DoubletFinder). This would cause "package 'DoubletFider' not found" error at runtime.

Doublets are a major technical artifact in droplet-based scRNA-seq that can mislead clustering 
analysis. When two cells are captured in the same droplet, they appear as a single cell with 
mixed transcriptional profiles. This can create false cell type clusters or obscure real biological 
variation. DoubletFinder uses simulated doublets and nearest-neighbor analysis to identify these 
artifacts. Essential QC step before clustering and annotation.

This will be fixed in the next commit.

Verified by: N/A - contains known error to be fixed.
