Ramin Yazdani | Single-Cell RNA-Seq QC and Clustering | main | feat(qc): Implement outlier detection QC filtering with MAD

Implemented statistical outlier detection using Median Absolute Deviation (MAD) for adaptive, 
data-driven QC thresholds. This provides an alternative to fixed thresholds that adapts to each 
dataset's distribution.

Modified scrna_analysis.r to add:
- filter_QC_outlier() function implementing MAD-based outlier detection:
  * Calculate MAD for log10(nCount) and log10(nFeature)
  * Identify outliers as cells >3 MADs from median
  * Remove cells with mitochondrial % >20% (fixed threshold for biological reasons)
- Outlier visualization functions showing distribution and cutoffs
- Comparison statistics with threshold method

Outlier detection adapts to each dataset's distribution rather than using universal thresholds, 
making it more appropriate for diverse datasets. MAD is robust to extreme values and handles 
skewed distributions better than standard deviation. This approach complements hard thresholds 
by being data-driven.

The 3-MAD cutoff is standard in statistics for identifying extreme outliers while being 
conservative enough to avoid removing good cells from natural biological variation.

Verified by: Code review of MAD calculation and outlier detection logic.
