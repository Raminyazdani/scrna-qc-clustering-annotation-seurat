Ramin Yazdani | Single-Cell RNA-Seq QC and Clustering | main | feat(integration): Integrate samples using anchors for batch effect removal

Completed Seurat integration by using identified anchors to correct for batch effects while 
preserving biological variation between cell types and conditions.

Modified scrna_analysis.r to add:
- IntegrateData() using computed anchors to create corrected expression matrix
- Re-run PCA on integrated data (captures biological variation)
- Re-run clustering on integrated space with multiple resolutions
- Re-run UMAP on integrated data for visualization
- Generate comprehensive comparison plots:
  * Side-by-side UMAP: uncorrected vs corrected colored by sample
  * Side-by-side UMAP: uncorrected vs corrected colored by cluster
  * Quantify mixing metrics (sample entropy within clusters)
- Save as merged_samples_corrected.rds

Batch correction using anchors removes technical differences (donor, batch effects) while preserving 
biological differences (BMMC vs CD34+, cell type variation). The integration should improve mixing 
of samples while maintaining separation of biologically distinct cell types.

Visual comparison shows whether integration improved sample mixing. Before integration, cells may 
cluster by sample/donor (technical). After integration, cells should cluster by biology (cell type). 
Quantitative mixing metrics verify improvement. Seurat integration is considered gold standard for 
scRNA-seq batch correction, balancing batch removal with biological preservation.

Verified by: Code review of integration implementation and comparison visualizations.
