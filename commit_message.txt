Ramin Yazdani | Single-Cell RNA-Seq QC and Clustering | main | feat(pca): Implement data scaling and principal component analysis

Added data scaling to normalize gene expression levels and PCA for initial dimensionality reduction 
from thousands of genes to interpretable principal components.

Modified scrna_analysis.r to add:
- ScaleData() on variable features:
  * Centers data to mean = 0 for each gene
  * Scales data to variance = 1 for each gene  
  * Optional regression of unwanted variation sources
- RunPCA() with 50 principal components calculated
- PCA visualization functions:
  * PC loadings showing genes contributing to each PC
  * PC scatter plots (PC1 vs PC2, etc.)
  * Colored by sample, cell type, or QC metrics

Scaling (z-score normalization) ensures highly expressed genes don't dominate downstream analyses. 
Without scaling, genes with high absolute expression would have more influence than genes with 
high biological variation but lower expression.

PCA reduces dimensionality from thousands of genes to tens of principal components while retaining 
the major sources of variation in the data. This dramatically improves computational efficiency 
for clustering while removing technical noise captured in later PCs.

Calculated 50 PCs (more than typically needed) to allow flexible downstream selection of optimal 
dimensionality for this dataset.

Verified by: Code review of scaling and PCA implementation.
