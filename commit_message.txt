Ramin Yazdani | Single-Cell RNA-Seq QC and Clustering | main | feat(qc): Fix overly strict QC threshold values

Fixed the QC thresholds in combined filtering strategy that were too strict and would have removed 
valid cells with good quality. Reverted to standard literature-based thresholds.

Modified scrna_analysis.r:
- Min genes per cell: 500 → 200 (standard minimum from literature)
- Max mitochondrial %: 15% → 20% (standard maximum for dying cells)

The previous overly strict thresholds (min genes=500, max mt%=15%) would have removed many good 
quality cells. Cells with 200-500 genes can still represent valid biological states, especially 
for certain cell types with naturally lower transcriptional activity. Similarly, the 15% mt% 
cutoff is too conservative and would unnecessarily exclude cells.

Proper threshold selection is critical in scRNA-seq QC. Too strict thresholds lead to loss of 
good cells, reduced statistical power, and potentially biased cell type composition. Too lenient 
thresholds lead to inclusion of low-quality cells that add noise. Literature standards (200 genes 
minimum, 20% mt maximum) provide a good balance based on extensive empirical evidence.

This fix ensures the combined QC strategy properly balances quality control with cell retention.

Verified by: Code review confirming threshold values match literature standards.
