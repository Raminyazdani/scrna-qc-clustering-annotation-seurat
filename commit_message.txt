Ramin Yazdani | Single-Cell RNA-Seq QC and Clustering | main | feat(doublet): Fix DoubletFinder library import typo

Fixed typo in DoubletFinder import statement that would have caused runtime error when loading 
the package. Also added installation instructions for clarity.

Modified scrna_analysis.r:
- Line 13: library(DoubletFider) → library(DoubletFinder)
- Added installation comment:
  # Install from GitHub if not already installed:
  # remotes::install_github("chris-mcginnis-ucsf/DoubletFinder")
  library(DoubletFinder)

The typo "DoubletFider" instead of "DoubletFinder" would cause immediate failure when R tries to 
load the package, with error: "there is no package called 'DoubletFider'". This would prevent the 
entire script from running.

Package names in R must be exact - even a single character difference causes failure. The fix 
corrects the spelling to the actual package name. Adding installation instructions helps users 
who don't have the package installed yet, as DoubletFinder is not on CRAN and must be installed 
from GitHub using remotes or devtools.

This ensures the script can properly load DoubletFinder and proceed with doublet detection, which 
is essential for removing technical artifacts before clustering.

Verified by: Package name verification against GitHub repository chris-mcginnis-ucsf/DoubletFinder.
