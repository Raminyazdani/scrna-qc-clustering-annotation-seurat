Ramin Yazdani | Single-Cell RNA-Seq QC and Clustering | main | WIP(docs): Add final documentation and save results

Saved final integrated and annotated dataset. Created comprehensive README documentation covering 
the complete analysis pipeline. However, contains path and filename errors that need correction.

Files Created/Modified:
- Saved final_annotated.rds - complete annotated Seurat object with all analyses
- README.md - Major documentation update covering:
  * Complete pipeline overview with step-by-step descriptions
  * All analysis sections with line number references to code
  * Setup and installation instructions for R and packages
  * Data requirements and expected file locations
  * Complete list of expected outputs (RDS objects, plots)
  * Reproducibility notes (random seed, package versions)
  * Troubleshooting guidance

MISTAKES INTRODUCED:
- README still references "scbi_ds1/" as data folder (should be "data/")
- README mentions running from "SCB1 directory" that doesn't exist (should be repo root)
- README shows script name as "project_script.r" (should be "scrna_analysis.r")
- Contains academic timeline references (e.g., "week3") in output filenames

These path inconsistencies and academic traces would confuse users trying to reproduce the analysis. 
Copy-paste errors from academic course context that weren't cleaned up.

Comprehensive documentation is essential for reproducibility and portfolio presentation, but 
accuracy is critical. Will be fixed in next commit for portfolio readiness.

Verified by: N/A - contains known errors to be fixed.
