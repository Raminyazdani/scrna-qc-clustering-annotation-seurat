Ramin Yazdani | Single-Cell RNA-Seq QC and Clustering | main | feat(qc): Implement QC metrics calculation functions

Added functions to calculate standard scRNA-seq quality control metrics including mitochondrial, 
hemoglobin, ribosomal, and ERCC spike-in percentages. These metrics are the foundation of quality 
control and must be calculated before filtering.

Modified scrna_analysis.r to add:
- Calculate mitochondrial gene percentage (^MT-) to identify dying cells
- Calculate hemoglobin gene percentage (^HB[^(P)]) to detect blood contamination
- Calculate ribosomal gene percentage (^RP[SL]) to assess ribosome abundance
- Calculate ERCC spike-in percentage (^ERCC) for technical controls
- Functions to add these metrics to Seurat object metadata

Implementation uses regex-based gene set identification and calculates percentages relative to 
total UMI counts. These metrics identify low-quality cells, dying cells (high mt%), and technical 
artifacts that should be removed before downstream analysis.

QC metrics are essential for identifying problematic cells. Mitochondrial content is particularly 
important as high mt% indicates dying/stressed cells. These metrics inform filtering thresholds.

Verified by: Manual code review of QC metric calculations.
