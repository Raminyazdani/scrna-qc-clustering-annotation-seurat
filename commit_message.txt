Ramin Yazdani | Single-Cell RNA-Seq QC and Clustering | main | feat(qc): Implement threshold-based QC filtering strategy

Implemented the first QC filtering approach using hard thresholds for minimum/maximum gene counts, 
UMI counts, and mitochondrial percentage. This provides a baseline filtering strategy.

Modified scrna_analysis.r to add:
- filter_QC_threshold() function with conservative thresholds:
  * Min genes per cell: 200 (standard literature minimum)
  * Max genes per cell: 6000 (removes potential doublets)
  * Min UMIs per cell: 500 (ensures sufficient sequencing depth)
  * Max mitochondrial %: 20% (removes dying/stressed cells)
- Visualization functions for pre/post filtering comparison
- Cell count summaries to quantify filtering impact

Threshold-based filtering is the most common QC approach in scRNA-seq analysis. These thresholds 
are based on literature standards and provide interpretable, reproducible filtering rules. The 
approach is simple, fast, and provides a baseline for comparison with statistical methods.

Conservative thresholds balance quality control with cell retention to maintain statistical power 
and avoid biasing cell type composition.

Verified by: Code review of threshold values and filtering logic.
