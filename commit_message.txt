Ramin Yazdani | Single-Cell RNA-Seq QC and Clustering | main | feat(normalization): Implement data normalization and variable feature selection

Implemented log-normalization and highly variable gene identification to focus analysis on genes 
with biological signal rather than technical noise. Essential preprocessing step before 
dimensionality reduction.

Modified scrna_analysis.r to add:
- NormalizeData() with log-normalization and default scale factor of 10,000
- FindVariableFeatures() using variance stabilizing transformation (vst method)
- Selection of top 2000 variable genes for downstream analysis
- Visualization of variance-mean relationship across genes
- Top 10 most variable genes labeled on plot for interpretation

Log-normalization corrects for differences in sequencing depth across cells, making expression 
values comparable. The scale factor (10,000) normalizes to counts per 10,000 molecules. Variable 
feature selection identifies genes with high cell-to-cell variation that likely reflect biological 
processes rather than technical noise.

Focusing on variable genes (2000 of ~20,000 total) reduces dimensionality while retaining 
biological signal. This improves computational efficiency and increases signal-to-noise ratio for 
downstream clustering. The vst method is more stable than traditional mean-variance relationship 
modeling.
