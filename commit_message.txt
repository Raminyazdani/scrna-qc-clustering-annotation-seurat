Ramin Yazdani | Single-Cell RNA-Seq QC and Clustering | main | feat(processing): Process all 4 samples through complete analysis pipeline

Applied the complete processing pipeline (work_sample_seurat function) to each QC-filtered sample 
individually, generating sample-specific results and removing doublets before multi-sample integration.

Modified scrna_analysis.r to add:
- Loop applying work_sample_seurat() to each of 4 QC-filtered samples
- Parallel processing of samples where possible for efficiency
- Per-sample outputs generated:
  * PCA plots with variance explained
  * Elbow plots showing optimal PC selection
  * UMAP plots colored by clusters, QC metrics, and metadata
  * t-SNE plots for cross-validation of structure
  * Feature plots showing key QC metrics and genes
  * Doublet detection results and removal statistics
- Save processed samples list: samples_seurats_list_qc_finished.rds

Processing samples individually before integration allows critical quality checks: (1) identify 
sample-specific patterns or problems, (2) assess each sample's quality independently, (3) verify 
good cell type representation in each sample, (4) detect technical issues that might affect 
integration, (5) ensure doublet removal worked properly in each sample.

Individual sample clustering reveals whether cell types are present across samples or sample-
specific, informing integration strategy. This step is essential quality control before pooling 
samples.
