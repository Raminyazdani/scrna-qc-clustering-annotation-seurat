Ramin Yazdani | Single-Cell RNA-Seq QC and Clustering | main | feat(visualization): Implement UMAP and t-SNE visualization; create master processing function

Added UMAP and t-SNE dimensionality reduction for 2D visualization. Created comprehensive 
work_sample_seurat() function that orchestrates the entire processing pipeline from QC-filtered 
object to fully processed, doublet-free dataset.

Modified scrna_analysis.r to add:
- RunUMAP() for 2D visualization preserving both local and global structure
- RunTSNE() for alternative 2D visualization (local structure emphasis)
- work_sample_seurat() master processing function:
  * Input: QC-filtered Seurat object
  * Pipeline steps: Normalize → Variable features → Scale → PCA → Auto PC selection → 
    Cluster → UMAP → t-SNE → DoubletFinder → Remove doublets
  * Output: Processed, doublet-free Seurat object with all embeddings
  * Generates comprehensive PNG visualizations at each stage

The master function ensures consistent analysis across samples. Both UMAP and t-SNE provide 
complementary views - UMAP better preserves global structure while t-SNE emphasizes local 
neighborhoods. Cross-validation between methods helps confirm that observed structures are robust.

Integrated DoubletFinder removal ensures artifacts are removed before downstream analysis. 
Extensive visualization outputs enable quality control at each processing stage. Reusable function 
design allows efficient processing of multiple samples with identical methodology.

Verified by: Code review of visualization and pipeline orchestration logic.
