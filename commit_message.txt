Ramin Yazdani | Single-Cell RNA-Seq QC and Clustering | main | feat(pca): Implement automatic PC selection with multiple criteria

Added automatic selection of significant principal components using multiple complementary criteria 
to remove subjective decision-making and adapt to dataset complexity.

Modified scrna_analysis.r to add:
- Cumulative variance explained calculation across PCs
- Elbow method: identifies where scree plot curve flattens
- 90% variance threshold: finds minimum PCs explaining 90% of variance
- Standard deviation analysis: identifies where PC stdev drops below 5%
- Conservative selection: takes minimum of all methods to avoid overfitting
- Elbow plot visualization with selected PC count marked

Implementation uses data-driven dimensionality selection rather than arbitrary fixed PC counts. 
Multiple selection criteria provide robustness - if one method fails or gives unreasonable result, 
others compensate. Taking the minimum (conservative approach) ensures we don't include noisy PCs 
that could harm clustering.

Automatic PC selection is critical because optimal dimensionality varies by dataset. Too few PCs 
lose biological signal. Too many PCs include technical noise. Data-driven selection adapts to each 
dataset's complexity and signal-to-noise characteristics. Visual validation through elbow plots 
allows manual verification of automated selection.
