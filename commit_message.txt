Ramin Yazdani | Single-Cell RNA-Seq QC and Clustering | main | feat(enrichment): Implement GO enrichment analysis using enrichR

Integrated enrichR for Gene Ontology enrichment analysis of differentially expressed genes, 
translating gene lists into biological insights about processes, locations, and molecular functions.

Modified scrna_analysis.r to add:
- enrichR integration with three GO databases:
  * GO_Biological_Process_2021 (what are cells doing?)
  * GO_Cellular_Component_2021 (where are proteins located?)
  * GO_Molecular_Function_2021 (what molecular activities?)
- Enrichment analysis for top 100 DEGs from each comparison
- Combined p-value scoring for ranking enriched terms
- Adjusted p-values (Benjamini-Hochberg) for multiple testing correction
- Bar plots of top 10 enriched terms per ontology per comparison
- Export complete enrichment results as CSV for further analysis
- Interpretation guidance in comments

GO enrichment translates gene lists into biological meaning. Answers critical questions: "What 
biological processes distinguish T cells from B cells?" or "What pathways are active in CD34+ 
cells?" Enrichment statistics reveal whether observed gene overlaps are greater than expected by 
chance.

Using three GO ontologies provides comprehensive functional understanding. Biological Process 
reveals cellular activities, Cellular Component shows subcellular localization patterns, Molecular 
Function identifies catalytic and binding activities. This biological context is essential for 
interpreting results and generating hypotheses for validation.
