Ramin Yazdani | Single-Cell RNA-Seq QC and Clustering | main | feat(annotation): Implement manual annotation using canonical marker genes

Added manual cell type annotation using well-established canonical marker genes for bone marrow 
cell types, providing expert-driven validation of automated annotations.

Modified scrna_analysis.r to add:
- Define marker gene sets for major bone marrow cell types:
  * T cells: CD3D, CD3E, CD4, CD8A (T cell receptor and co-receptors)
  * B cells: CD19, CD79A, MS4A1/CD20 (B cell lineage markers)
  * Monocytes: CD14, LYZ, FCGR3A/CD16 (classical and non-classical monocytes)
  * NK cells: NCAM1/CD56, GNLY, NKG7 (natural killer markers)
  * HSCs/Progenitors: CD34, KIT, THY1 (stem and progenitor markers)
  * Dendritic cells: FCER1A, CD1C (DC markers)
- FeaturePlot() for each marker showing spatial expression patterns
- DotPlot() showing marker expression across all clusters
- VlnPlot() for key markers quantifying expression distributions

Manual annotation uses domain knowledge and established markers from literature. Feature plots 
reveal which clusters express which markers and their spatial organization. Dot plots provide 
systematic view of marker-cluster relationships, showing both expression level and fraction of 
cells expressing.

This validates automated annotations - if SingleR called a cluster "T cells" and we see high 
CD3/CD4/CD8 expression, that confirms the annotation. Discrepancies highlight clusters needing 
expert curation.

Verified by: Code review of marker gene selections and visualization implementation.
