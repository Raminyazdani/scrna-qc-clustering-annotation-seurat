Ramin Yazdani | Single-Cell RNA-Seq QC and Clustering | main | feat(clustering): Implement multi-resolution clustering exploration

Extended clustering to test multiple resolution parameters, allowing systematic comparison of 
granularity levels and selection of optimal clustering for biological interpretation.

Modified scrna_analysis.r to add:
- Test multiple resolutions: 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.8, 1.0, 1.2
- Store all clustering results in Seurat object metadata for comparison
- Side-by-side UMAP visualization grid showing all resolutions
- Cluster count vs resolution plot to quantify granularity
- Analysis tools to compare and select biologically meaningful resolution

Systematic resolution testing reveals the hierarchical structure in the data. Low resolutions 
(0.1-0.3) identify broad cell types, while high resolutions (1.0-1.2) identify subtypes and states. 
No single "correct" resolution exists - the optimal choice depends on biological question and 
desired granularity.

Visual comparison helps select resolution matching biological expectations. For bone marrow, we 
expect major cell types (T cells, B cells, monocytes, etc.) plus some subtypes. Testing range 
from 0.1 to 1.2 covers from very coarse (few major groups) to fine-grained (many subtle 
distinctions). This systematic exploration informs the final resolution choice for downstream 
annotation and analysis.

Verified by: Code review of resolution testing implementation.
