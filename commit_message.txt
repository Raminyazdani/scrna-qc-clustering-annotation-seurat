Ramin Yazdani | Single-Cell RNA-Seq QC and Clustering | main | feat(setup): Initial commit - Project structure and documentation

Set up the basic repository structure with README, .gitignore, and initial documentation. 
Established the project goals, requirements, and expected data inputs for single-cell RNA 
sequencing analysis of bone marrow samples.

Files created:
- README.md with project overview and initial goals
- .gitignore with R-specific ignores (*.rds, *.RData, *.Rhistory, .Rproj.user, plots/, outputs/)
- .github/ directory with basic templates

This commit establishes the project foundation and documentation before any code implementation.
Every good project starts with clear documentation and proper ignore rules to maintain a clean
repository structure throughout development.

Verified by: Manual inspection of initial files and structure.
