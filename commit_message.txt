Ramin Yazdani | Single-Cell RNA-Seq QC and Clustering | main | feat(data): Load all bone marrow samples and apply QC filtering

Implemented data loading for all 4 bone marrow samples (2 BMMC replicates from one donor, 2 CD34+ 
samples from different donors) and applied the chosen QC filtering strategy consistently across 
all samples.

Modified scrna_analysis.r to add execution code:
- Set data folder: relative_path_data <- "data"
- Load 4 samples with complete metadata:
  * GSM4138872_scRNA_BMMC_D1T1.rds (Donor 1, BMMC replicate 1, Male)
  * GSM4138873_scRNA_BMMC_D1T2.rds (Donor 1, BMMC replicate 2, Male)
  * GSM4138874_scRNA_CD34_D2T1.rds (Donor 2, CD34+ enriched, Female)
  * GSM4138875_scRNA_CD34_D3T1.rds (Donor 3, CD34+ enriched, Female)
- Calculate QC metrics for all samples (mt%, hb%, rb%, ERCC%)
- Apply chosen QC strategy (outlier + threshold combined) consistently
- Generate per-sample QC violin plots for visual assessment
- Save QC-filtered samples list for downstream processing

Loading all samples enables comparison of QC distributions across samples and ensures consistent 
filtering. Metadata tracking (donor, sex, cell type) is essential for identifying and correcting 
batch effects. The 4 samples represent 2 biological conditions (BMMC vs CD34+) with appropriate 
replication for statistical analysis.

Verified by: Code review of sample loading and QC application.
