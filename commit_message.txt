Ramin Yazdani | Single-Cell RNA-Seq QC and Clustering | main | feat(de): Implement multiple DE comparisons with volcano plots

Extended DE analysis to perform multiple biologically relevant comparisons and created rich 
visualizations for interpreting results. Identifies cell type markers and condition-specific genes.

Modified scrna_analysis.r to add:
- Comparison 1: B cells vs T cells (major lymphoid lineage differences)
- Comparison 2: T cells vs Monocytes (lymphoid vs myeloid lineage differences)
- Comparison 3: BMMC vs CD34+ samples (condition/enrichment strategy differences)
- For each comparison, generate:
  * Volcano plot (log2 fold-change vs -log10 adjusted p-value)
  * Label top 10 upregulated genes (highest log2FC, significant)
  * Label top 10 downregulated genes (lowest log2FC, significant)
  * Heatmap of top 50 differentially expressed genes
  * Export complete results as CSV for further analysis
- Statistical summaries (number of DEGs at different thresholds)

Multiple comparisons reveal different biological insights. Cell type comparisons identify lineage-
defining markers and functional differences. Condition comparisons reveal effects of enrichment 
strategy (BMMC = total bone marrow, CD34+ = stem/progenitor enriched).

Volcano plots are standard for DE visualization, showing both magnitude (fold-change) and 
significance (p-value). Heatmaps reveal expression patterns across cells. Exporting results 
enables pathway analysis, literature comparison, and hypothesis generation.

Verified by: Code review of comparison design and visualization implementation.
