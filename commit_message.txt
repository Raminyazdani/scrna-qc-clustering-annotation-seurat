Ramin Yazdani | Single-Cell RNA-Seq QC and Clustering | main | feat(data-loading): Add data loading functions and initial setup

Implemented core helper functions for loading scRNA-seq datasets from RDS files. Set up library 
imports, configured parallel processing, and established reproducible random seed.

Created scrna_analysis.r with:
- Library imports (Seurat, ggplot2, dplyr, etc.)
- Reproducibility: set.seed(42)
- Performance: parallel processing configuration with options(mc.cores = detectCores() - 1)
- get_sample_info() function to extract sample metadata
- loadDataSet() function to load RDS files into Seurat objects
- addMetaData() function to add donor, replicate, and sex metadata

Configured for portability using getwd() for project root detection. Sample metadata structure 
defined for 4 samples: 2 BMMC replicates and 2 CD34+ samples.

Establishing the foundation for data loading is essential before any analysis. Reproducibility 
(random seed) and performance (parallel processing) configured from the start.

Verified by: Code review of data loading functions and structure.
