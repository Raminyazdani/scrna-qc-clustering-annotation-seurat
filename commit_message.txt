Ramin Yazdani | Single-Cell RNA-Seq QC and Clustering | main | feat(annotation): Refine cell type annotations and create consensus labels

Compared automated (SingleR) and manual (marker-based) annotations, resolved conflicts through 
expert curation, and created final consensus cell type labels combining strengths of both approaches.

Modified scrna_analysis.r to add:
- Systematic comparison of SingleR vs manual marker-based labels
- Confusion matrix showing agreement/disagreement between methods
- Identify ambiguous clusters where methods disagree
- Manual expert curation for conflicted clusters:
  * Re-examine marker expression
  * Consider cluster-specific DE genes
  * Use biological knowledge to resolve conflicts
- Create final consensus labels combining both approaches
- Add to metadata as "cell_type_final" for downstream use
- Generate final UMAP with consensus labels and color scheme
- Final cell type proportion analysis by sample and condition

Combining automated and manual annotation gives most confident labels. Automated annotation 
provides consistency and objectivity, avoiding confirmation bias. Manual annotation provides 
domain expertise and nuanced interpretation that reference-based methods may miss. Consensus 
approach reduces errors inherent in either method alone.

Agreement between methods provides confidence. Disagreement highlights areas needing careful 
expert review. Some cell types (rare, transitional, or novel) may require manual override of 
automated labels. Final annotated dataset is now ready for biological interpretation and 
downstream analyses.

Verified by: Code review of label comparison and consensus creation logic.
