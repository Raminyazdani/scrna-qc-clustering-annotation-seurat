Ramin Yazdani | Single-Cell RNA-Seq QC and Clustering | main | feat(polish): Portfolio-ready - Fix paths, rename files, remove academic traces

Final polishing pass to make repository portfolio-ready. Fixed all path inconsistencies, renamed 
files for professional clarity, removed academic/assignment traces, and added portfolio documentation.

Files Modified:
- scrna_analysis.r (renamed from project_script.r):
  * Line 340: Confirmed relative_path_data <- "data" (correct path)
  * Line 399: Removed "tutorial" reference, made comment professional
  * Lines 864, 1097, 1133: Changed corrected_week3.rds → final_annotated.rds throughout

- README.md - Comprehensive path and reference fixes:
  * Line 41: scbi_ds1/ → data/ (standard descriptive folder name)
  * Line 50: Removed "SCB1 directory" phantom reference, clarified "data/ folder in repo root"
  * Lines 92-95: Removed "cd SCB1" command, updated script name to scrna_analysis.r
  * Line 119: corrected_week3.rds → final_annotated.rds
  * Line 140: "SCB1 directory" → "repository root"
  * Removed academic context and timeline references throughout

Files Created:
- project_identity.md - Professional project identity and metadata
- report.md - Complete portfolio-readiness report documenting all changes
- suggestion.txt - Issue ledger with all findings and STATUS=APPLIED
- suggestions_done.txt - Applied changes log with before/after snippets and locators

Portfolio presentation requires professional polish and consistency. All documentation must align 
with actual code and file structure. Repository is now portfolio-ready with professional naming, 
consistent correct paths, no academic traces, and comprehensive aligned documentation.

Verified by: Manual verification of all path references, filename consistency, code-docs alignment.
