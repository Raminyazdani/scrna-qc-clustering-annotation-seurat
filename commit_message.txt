Ramin Yazdani | Single-Cell RNA-Seq QC and Clustering | main | feat(trajectory): Implement trajectory analysis using monocle3

Integrated monocle3 for trajectory inference focusing on lymphoid lineage (HSCs → B/T cells), 
reconstructing developmental pseudotime to reveal cell state transitions and differentiation paths.

Modified scrna_analysis.r to add:
- Convert Seurat to cell_data_set (monocle3 format) preserving metadata
- Subset to biologically relevant trajectory: lymphoid lineage (HSCs, B cells, T cells)
- learn_graph() with partition-based graph abstraction to learn trajectory structure
- order_cells() to calculate pseudotime ordering along learned trajectory
- Identify root cells (HSCs/progenitors) based on CD34 expression as differentiation start
- Comprehensive trajectory visualizations:
  * Colored by cell type (shows expected developmental progression)
  * Colored by pseudotime (shows ordering along trajectory)
  * Colored by sample (verifies trajectory not driven by batch)
- graph_test() to identify genes varying significantly along pseudotime
- Plot top trajectory-associated genes showing expression dynamics

Trajectory inference reveals developmental relationships and cell state transitions. Particularly 
relevant for bone marrow where active hematopoiesis occurs. Pseudotime ordering places cells along 
continuous developmental path from stem cells to mature lymphocytes.

Genes varying with pseudotime likely regulate differentiation. These trajectory-associated genes 
are candidates for experimental validation as differentiation drivers or markers of transitional 
states.

Verified by: Code review of monocle3 implementation and trajectory visualization.
