Ramin Yazdani | Single-Cell RNA-Seq QC and Clustering | main | feat(integration): Merge all samples without batch correction for baseline

Merged all 4 processed samples into a single Seurat object without batch correction, creating 
a baseline to evaluate whether batch effects exist and whether batch correction is necessary.

Modified scrna_analysis.r to add:
- Simple merge() of all 4 samples into single object
- Re-run normalization and scaling on merged data
- PCA on merged object using variable features
- Clustering on merged data with multiple resolutions
- UMAP visualization colored by multiple variables:
  * Sample origin (to visualize batch effects)
  * Cluster assignments
  * Donor ID (to see donor-specific patterns)
  * Cell type/condition (BMMC vs CD34+)
- Save as merged_samples_uncorrected.rds

Creating an uncorrected baseline is essential for evaluating integration quality. If samples 
already mix well without correction, aggressive batch correction may not be needed and could 
remove biological signal. If samples show strong separation by technical variables (donor, batch), 
then integration is necessary.

Visual inspection of UMAP colored by sample/donor reveals whether cells cluster by biological 
similarity (good) or technical factors (bad). This baseline informs whether to proceed with 
integration and allows quantitative assessment of integration improvement.

Verified by: Code review of merge and visualization implementation.
