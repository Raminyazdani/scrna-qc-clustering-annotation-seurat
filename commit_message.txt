Ramin Yazdani | Single-Cell RNA-Seq QC and Clustering | main | WIP(qc): Add combined QC filtering strategy

Combined threshold and outlier filtering approaches for comprehensive QC. Applied both methods 
sequentially to leverage strengths of each approach. However, threshold values were set too 
strictly in this implementation.

Modified scrna_analysis.r to add:
- filter_QC_combined() function:
  * First apply outlier detection (MAD-based)
  * Then apply threshold filtering

MISTAKE INTRODUCED: Used overly strict threshold values:
- Min genes per cell: 500 (too strict, should be 200)
- Max mitochondrial %: 15% (too strict, should be 20%)

These strict thresholds would remove too many good quality cells, reducing statistical power and 
potentially biasing cell type composition. The min genes threshold of 500 is unnecessarily high 
and could remove valid cell types with naturally lower gene expression.

Combining methods leverages strengths of both approaches - outlier detection provides adaptive 
filtering while thresholds enforce biological constraints. However, incorrect parameter choices 
can negate these benefits.

This will be fixed in the next commit.

Verified by: N/A - contains known error to be fixed.
